# idealista iOS Challenge
The idealista iOS team is on the lookout for a new teammate! We’re on a mission to find someone who’s ready to dive into the exciting (and sometimes wild) world of iOS development. From building cool new features to squashing bugs, crafting pixel-perfect UIs, and making sure everything runs smoothly and securely — we’ve got plenty to keep you on your toes.

Think you’re up for the challenge? We could really use your skills to create the next generation of awesome features that will take our app to new heights. Whether it’s making sure our users have a seamless experience or pushing the limits of performance, we need someone who’s ready to jump in and make a real impact.

Here at idealista, we’re all about clean, maintainable code and solid testable components. If you love turning great ideas into reality, this might just be the perfect challenge for you!
